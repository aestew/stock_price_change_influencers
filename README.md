# stock_price_change_influencers
A linear regression analysis on how common company attributes have influenced stock prices in the first 60 days of the Trump Administration. The difference in stock price in the first 60 days of the Trump Administration was taken for all stocks in the Russell 3000 and a linear regression ran to understand if company attributes of sector, cap size, employee count, volume change, dividend and stock split action had a significant influence on stock price. P-values from model results indicated that sector and cap size were significant contributors to the change in stock prices, however the low R-squared value indicated that these descriptor variables were not comprehensive.
